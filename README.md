# Day-Planner

A simple Day Planner app.
When the user clicks the timeblocks, they are able to input text and save it using the save buttons. It displays the current date and time under the header. The save button on each line should only save input on the timeblock of the same line. The time blocks are color-coated based on current time; grey for the past, red for the present, and green for the future.
If the user saves their input and refreshes the page or closes the browser, the input should remain in the timeblocks upon returning.
